# budgeteer
A MEVN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, VueJS, NodeJS) stack app to track budgets and expenses

### Authentication and Authorization
User password is hashed by [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs) using a salt length of your choice. Authorization is handled via JWTs.

### Prerequisites
  - Add a .env file with the following variables and values:
    - BASE_URL=/api/v1
    - PORT=your desired port
    - DB_URL=your desired MongoDB URL
    - DB_USER=db username
    - DB_PASSWORD=db password
    - SALT=9
    - SECRET=your generated secret (easily generated by opening a node console and executing `require('crypto').randomBytes(40).toString('hex')`
    
### Installation 
Not ready for production. If ypu'd like to sandbox it, do the following:
  - Clone the repo to your desired folder
  - `cd` to the api folder and execute `npm run start`
  - `cd` to the client folder and execute `npm run serve`
  - Visit the app on `http://localhost:8080
  
### TODO
  - Build out CATEGORIES (CRUD)
  - Refactor code to use OOP (somewhat)
  - Implement dashboards and reporting
  - Incorporate OAuth2.0
  - Implement rate-limiting on the API
  - Implement performance optimization (caching, clustering, and production-level logging)
